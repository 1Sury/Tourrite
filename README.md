# Tourrite
Tourrite’ is the website made for the people who want 
to explore something out of ordinary. This is a travel website as its name sugests. This is created for the amazingly beautiful places one can travel in India which aren’t really popular. It can help the user to find some beautiful place which aren’t promted a lot but are worth travelling. It is made with the help of coding languages ‘html’ and ‘css’. As we know, the world is healing from covid and the places are slowing opening up for travel. But while 
travelling we sometimes overlook some beautiful places
because they aren’t well marketed. Our project is a small 
contribution to give those beautiful place in India their due recognition.
As we open ‘Tourrite’ we are directed to the home page. On the top left corner the name of site is written in bold letter. And on the right corner there are ‘HOME’, ‘PACKAGES’, ‘DESTINATION’ and ‘ABOUT US’ tab.  In the middle of the page there are ‘Welcome To India’, beneath that there is ‘Sign in’ tab.
It is a page that opens after  after you click on ‘Let’s tour in’ tab. It gives you an option to sign in or login. You can register your email or can login with facebook. You can enter password. You can enter otp and agree to terms and conditions to enter.
‘Package Page’ is a page where one can find the most featured places on website. And that can help you find packages related those pages. As for now it has ‘Gokarna beach’, ‘Lavasa’ and ‘Spiti Valley’.
‘Destination Page’ open when you tap the ‘Destination’.
It changes slides from one destination to another after  an interval of time. It gives the clients a glimspse of location but does provide enough which sparks curiosity of our clients.
